## Welcome to the basic statistics lessons package.

The notebooks in this package are intended to provide a basic foundation in statistical concepts as they relate to particle physics, 
so that more advaned materials are more accessible for self-study. 
Mistakes are my own (but please let me know if you see something fishy!)

[![Open in SWAN][openswan-image]][openswan-link]

To use this package the first time, either click the "Open in SWAN" button above, or go to https://swan.cern.ch. 

In both cases, startup the kernel in the default mode.

If you didn't "Open in SWAN", click the little cloud download icon. In the box, put the https url of this package: https://gitlab.cern.ch/hrussell/basicstats.git.

The package ends up in /eos/user/a/auser/SWAN_Projects/basicstats/.

In the future, you can cd into that directory (either by ssh'ing in lxplus, or through a terminal in SWAN) and update the git repository. If you want to make changes to a file, please do so through a branch + merge request.
